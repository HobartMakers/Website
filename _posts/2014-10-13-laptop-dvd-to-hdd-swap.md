Swapping the internal DVD writer for a hard disk, using a caddy bought from China.

My laptop is pretty zoomy with dual SSD in raid array, but lacks large storage capacity, but one of the advertised features was the ability to swap the optical drive for a hard drive ! I bought it with a view to doing exactly that.

I had thought it would be a simple matter of buying a cheap caddy, install an hard disk and pop out the DVD and slide in the HDD (I had hoped for hot swap, since the connection is SATA this should be a problem).  When I got the laptop and looked up the price of the caddy it was three figures :( and looking at the laptop there was no option to hot swap (one of the screws holding the DVD was under the bottom panel, which was held inplace by multiple screws, one hidden under a "warranty void if removed" sticker (I'm not worried about that sticker as in Australia I have automatic Consumer Guarantees )

I decided to check aliexpress for a cheaper option and found several, as at October 2014 selling for around $20, so I bought one, waited impatiently as it went via Russia for some reason, then installed it in a very simple operation detailed here.  I may open the laptop up again and add a hole to access the screw for easy swapping.
