Some of you may have heard me talking about building my very own 3D printer.  Well the work has begun, albeit a little bit slower then I expected.  I have done a lot of research over the past month or so on printer design and I settled on building a modified Delta based printer.

The initial plan is to try and build as much of this as I can by myself from scratch and then use itself to make improvements.  This has required quite a bit of re thinking and changing materials to make life a bit easier.  

Sourcing the supplies has been interesting, especially in Hobart but apart from the initial purchase of all the Electronics from <http://stores.ebay.com.au/learcnc>, everything else I have been able to get locally.  The stainless steel rods I purchased from Stirlings <http://www.stirlingsaustralia.com.au/application/contact/tasmania.html> and then cut the 6m rod down into the 65cm lengths I needed at home. Bunnings has come to the rescue for everything else.

OK, so for the rundown on what I have completed so far

1. Frame
2. All the boards with Tower supports
3. The actual tower runners with the arm rods
4. Sourced an ATX power supply with 2 x 18A 12v lines for power
5. The hotend holder plate with mounting points for the arms

Next week I hope to have the motors mounted and at least the arms moving.

Stay tuned for the next update or have a chat to me at any of the Wednesday night sessions if you want more info.
