Well, it has been a while since I posted an update on the progress of the Printer, well, it seems I got distracted :).

In the past few months I have managed to learn a lot about the Laser Cutter and have been proud to be part of the team helping to get it back in action.  You should see some improvements in that very soon as we have new mirrors arriving soon and progress is happening every week.

As for the printer, the initial design had some minor flaws, IE, I shouldn't have rushed the designs as I made a few mistakes in alignment which caused all the problems.  As such I have spent quite a bit more time re doing the mounts and hopefully I should be able to start printing them very soon.  This along with some CNC'd parts should get my 3D printer back online in the next month.

Stay tuned for some more updates soon and hopefully I will get cracking on a weekly run down on the wednesday night meetings as well for those that couldn't make it but would like to keep up with whats happening in the space.
