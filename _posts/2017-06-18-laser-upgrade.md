We have made a big step forward in our laser cutter upgrade. The conversion from unknown-driver-board (with LinuxCNC) to Raspberry Pi and GRBL Pi Hat (with LaserWeb) has been made. We are very pleased, and everything is working well. There are just a few refinements to make, and possibly a PCB to design and make to neaten things up.
