Hello everyone. Just a quick message to let you know that Social Night's are returning for 2015 from this Wednesday, 7 January. 

You can [find all the details here](https://hobarthackerspace.org.au/civicrm/event/info?reset=1&id=3) for our first one of the year. 

Our Social Night's are a perfect opportunity for non-members to visit, check our the space and the people that make it what it is. Visitors are most welcome!

Here's to a massive 2015.

Cheers
Craig Clark
HHS Vice President and wannabe maker! :)
