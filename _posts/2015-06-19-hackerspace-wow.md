Hobart Hackerspace Week of Workshops, now over two weeks :P

We have GovHack and we have our own lives and wives/husbands to deal with, so this time our Week of Workshops has a few breaks in the middle, but you still get all the excellence of learning new things from people who are really no smarter than you. Don't you love the honesty? You know it's true when most of these workshops are being run by Shane.

For financial members it's all free, non-members $10 (excluding the Wednesday evening session 8th Jul which is open to the public)

#### Mon 29 Jun 2015 - CNC - gcode
Do you know what gcode is? Can you understand what these machine instructions are?

We're going to have a session dedicated to the language of CNC machines the world over. 

7 - 9pm (no prerequisites)

#### Tue 30 Jun 2015- CNC - CAM
This session will cover basic tooling and material cutting theory, and how we go about generating a gcode file from a CAD drawing. We will look at the different ways of milling a 3D surface, and how to generate simple files for the CNC

7 - 9pm (prerequisites - either a CNC tooling or gcode workshop)

#### Mon 6th Jul 2015 - CAD (Primitives)
This is the very entry level FreeCAD course for people who want to draw basic components using primitive shapes. It's like the LEGO of CAD, blocks stacked upon each other but at the end of it all you have a design ready for the 3D printer or CNC

7 - 9pm (no prerequisites - byo computer with a current version of FreeCAD installed)

#### Tue 7th Jul 2015 - CAD (Draft)
In this session we will look at more advanced features of freeCAD, such as using constraints to shift a measured or drawn complex design in to a series of drafts and then turn them in to a 3D object.

7 - 9pm (no prerequisites but the primitives course may be beneficial - byo computer with a current version of FreeCAD installed)

#### Wed 8th Jul 2015 - Celestial navigation
Yep, no kidding.. This is going to be a short session where we'll ask the question, "how did those dutch explorers get most of the way around the world in the 1600s?" Have you ever wondered? Not all of them crashed like Dirk Hartog, but how? The answer is surprisingly simple

8 - 9pm (no prerequisites)

#### Thu 9th Jul 2015 - ATTINY, the tiny soution to everything
So you need to flash a light, respond to an input or do some simple repetitive task. The ATTINY is a great replacement for many analog circuits and can be programmed to do all the things you need and more. We're going to look at the chip, the architecture and some simple programs to replace the need for things like 555 (timer) circuits.

7 - 9pm  (no prerequisites - byo compuer with arduino IDE installed)
