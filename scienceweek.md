This year we were lucky enough to recieve a seed funding grant to help us run an event during National Science Week.

Here is the event description:

There are many ways to connect IoT devices to the Internet. This workshop will introduce some cheap sensors and controllers you can put in your garden or house and explain the networks you can connect to, focusing on the new LoRa radios for low power and long range.

This event will run on Thursday 17th August 2017.

Prices and schedule to be confirmed.
