# Events


## Regular events

* Open nights are every Tuesday from 6pm - 9pm, and we welcome everyone!

* Side-projects Saturday is _usually_ every second Saturday afternoon. Double check in the [chatroom](https://riot.im/app/#/room/#hobartmakers:matrix.org) or check the [facebook events list](https://www.facebook.com/groups/hobartmakers/events/) to make sure. The goal is to bring an incomplete project and get some work done!

## Workshops and one-off events

These are also listed on our [Facebook events list](https://www.facebook.com/groups/hobartmakers/events/) and our [TidyHQ events list](https://hobartmakers.tidyhq.com/public/schedule/events)
