<p>Hi and welcome to my first live update from a Weekly Meeting.</p>

<p>There is a bit of tinkering going on tonight as well as some visitors being shown around the place.</p>

<p>Brian is working on “Repairing” an old british electric beater.  Looks interesting and will be great to see it working at another meeting.  Maybe he can mix us some nice batter to make some donuts.</p>

<p>One of the Mark’s is working on a homebuilt Infrared thermometer using and Arduino Nano with a infrared temprature sensor (Freetronics) and a nice OLED display from a kickstarter (See, some things do actually eventuate from Kickstarter).</p>

<p><strong>BREAKING NEWS</strong> - As I am typing this the space’s new 3D Printer has just turned up.  Looks like a Sunday Session coming up. The new printer is a Duinotech TL-4100 Delta Kit.  Stay tuned for more updates on this.</p>

<p>We are also looking at one of the new mini CNC’s.  A very nice looking device which will set you back about $650 from Ebay.  More details will follow in a post later this week.</p>

<p>David is busy engraving a logo onto a chopping board for a prize.  At least we have some use coming to the Laser Cutter.  We are currently looking into upgrading the laser tube on this so it should be more usefull soon.</p>

<p>We also have some general tidying up going on around the place.</p>

<p>It is good to see a buzz of activity going on at the moment.  So heading into the cooler months the Hackspace seems to be picking up again which is good to see.</p>

<p>So tell your friends and get them coming along to join in the journey, plus no doubt get into some interesting conversations about what we are going to try and computerised next (yes we will eventually finish the knitting machine).</p>

<p>So see you next week with the next live blog and hopefully some other updates through the week.</p>
