<p>Tanya McLachlan-Troup and Mark Pearson have kindly donated their time to go and spend our $3000 grant money, awarded by The Mens Shed Association.</p>

<p>We applied for this grant around a year ago and it was granted a few months ago. We have finally got around to spending the money, and we are celebrating by having a BBQ next Wednesday (14 Dec 2016). We want you to join us to celebrate the purchasing of the new tools with the grant money!</p>

<p>Vegan sausages and gluten-free bread will be available.</p>

<p>Sausages are $1 and cans are $1.</p>

<p>So please come along to help celebrate and check out the tools!</p>
