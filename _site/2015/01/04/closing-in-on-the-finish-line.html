<p>Well, I can see a light at the end of the tunnel.  After a nice holiday break I managed to spend a few hours down at hackspace watching my last pieces printing on the MakerBot.  3 sets of rail guides later I now have a fully assembled printer :)</p>

<p>The next step on the path is to get the heatbed and hotend all mounted an ready to go and finalise the mounting of the electonics.</p>

<p>In a bit of a work session this weekend I have assembled all off the electronics and tested them with the modified ATX power supply.</p>

<p>So hopefully by the end of the week I will have a working 3D Delta Printer.</p>

<p>Fo those interested in seeing it alive I should be working on it as normal at the next Wednesday Social Night and hopefully making it move :)</p>

<p>I will post some pictures later.</p>
