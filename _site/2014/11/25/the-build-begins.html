<p>Some of you may have heard me talking about building my very own 3D printer.  Well the work has begun, albeit a little bit slower then I expected.  I have done a lot of research over the past month or so on printer design and I settled on building a modified Delta based printer.</p>

<p>The initial plan is to try and build as much of this as I can by myself from scratch and then use itself to make improvements.  This has required quite a bit of re thinking and changing materials to make life a bit easier.</p>

<p>Sourcing the supplies has been interesting, especially in Hobart but apart from the initial purchase of all the Electronics from <a href="http://stores.ebay.com.au/learcnc">http://stores.ebay.com.au/learcnc</a>, everything else I have been able to get locally.  The stainless steel rods I purchased from Stirlings <a href="http://www.stirlingsaustralia.com.au/application/contact/tasmania.html">http://www.stirlingsaustralia.com.au/application/contact/tasmania.html</a> and then cut the 6m rod down into the 65cm lengths I needed at home. Bunnings has come to the rescue for everything else.</p>

<p>OK, so for the rundown on what I have completed so far</p>

<ol>
  <li>Frame</li>
  <li>All the boards with Tower supports</li>
  <li>The actual tower runners with the arm rods</li>
  <li>Sourced an ATX power supply with 2 x 18A 12v lines for power</li>
  <li>The hotend holder plate with mounting points for the arms</li>
</ol>

<p>Next week I hope to have the motors mounted and at least the arms moving.</p>

<p>Stay tuned for the next update or have a chat to me at any of the Wednesday night sessions if you want more info.</p>
