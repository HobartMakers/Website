<p>Today I powered up the Mame console.
DO NOT ATTEMPT THIS
The wiring is dodgy and there is an exposed crt monitor in there with loose electronics.</p>

<p>Currently its using a pentium III</p>

<p>I am looking into upgrading it to a Pi and LCD.</p>

<p>Michael Sharman has done a great job wiring a keyboard controller to all the buttons and installing a menu driven by joystick, so I hope to copy that software and use on the pi.</p>

  <p>Hey Joe, glad to see your using it, sorry, I should have given you guys a warning about the state of the electronics and exposed high voltages !! I forgot it was in a such a mess. Glad you like the keyboard controller, I still have the notes on how I did that kicking around somewhere. â€“ Michael</p>
