<p>Someone finally sat down and set up this fine website with all new information about our workshops, membership, safety and other cool stuff.</p>

<p>The forum is gone for now due to lack of use, but we have replaced it with individual blogs. Each paid up member is entitled to have a blog where you can post things you’re working on, or start arguments if you like. People can comment, so it’s like a forum but a little bit cooler.</p>

<p>I will be turning this feature on for all paid up members, if you’re in a hurry pop me a message via the contact form.</p>

<p>Heading forward in 2014:
Wednesday nights will continue, these are now huge events with lots of people turning up. Our catering staff have been in fine form lately with BBQ dinners and hot dogs, if you have any requests or dietry requirements let us know and we’ll do our best.</p>

<p>Saturday afternoons have been great for machinery operating training and other courses and more targeted events. We usually post the details on our facebook page and twitter so get on to that!</p>

<p>Thanks everyone for your ongoing support</p>
