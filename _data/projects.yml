- project: Laser Cutter Upgrade 
  lead: Scott F
  description: Upgrade the inner workings of the laser cutter to use a Raspberry pi, a Arduino/GRBL PiHat, and Laserweb running on the pi.
  status: The upgrade is complete and everything works perfectly, and is usable. Next stage is to design and fabricate a PCB that houses all the functionality and connectors inside the machine, to neaten everything up.

- project: T-shirt printing
  lead: Mary
  description: Find a way to take orders and payment from members for screenprinted t-shirts, and print and deliver those t-shirts
  status: All orders are now fulfilled. Ready to take some more orders!

- project: Shapeoko tweaks
  lead: Craig
  description: The shapeoko is basically running, but needs limit switches, homing and e-stop added.
  status: Part-way through. Anyone can jump in and help if there is interest. We have determined the pinout from the DB9 port on the controller, and just need to wire those into the physical switches and test. Next step will be to add a spindle. Michael has a spindle and power supply that need repairing, but that we can use for this project.

- project: Electronics area upgrade
  lead: Craig
  description: The electronics and workshop area needs much better storage. Full-width, CRO-depth shelving above electonics workbench, and legs to hold the steel pegboard for general workshop tools.
  status: Measurements have been taken. On the lookout for free or low-cost shelving that is 1.5m wide, 400mm deep, and anything up to 1.5m tall. We have the tools and expertise to modify existing shelving, or we could make some from scratch if we invest a bit of money into materials. As for the pegboard legs - Craig probably has materials to get started on this, just need some time to get started on the project.

- project: Satnogs satellite rotator
  lead: Scott F
  description: Make a tripod with computerised motor-control of its direction and orientation
  status: Parts have been printed, and a tripod has been built - awaiting wiring and firmware completion and testing (to be confirmed - Scott?)

- project: Signage
  lead: Mary
  description: Improve the flipchart stand that we're using as a sandwich board. Needs a battery powered light, a big laminated printed logo, and an add-on scrolling LED unit (WS2812 based?) that can display custom messages. If we can set those messages via wifi - all the better!
  status: We have the printed sign, we have the light - it needs to be modded to run off the 12V SLA batteries Bob ordered. Mary has all the parts for the scrolling LED unit, and it's being built up on perf board. Almost done!
