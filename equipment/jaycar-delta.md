## About

The Jaycar delta 3D printer was bought with funds donated by both members and non-members (Thank you!). It's currently set up for use with PLA filament, and it uses the repetier host software. It's controlled by an arduino-based board.

[David Wilson's web page about the TL4100](https://dgwilson.wordpress.com/2016/06/12/3d-printing-with-the-jaycar-delta-rostok-tl-4100/) looks like a very useful source of information about this printer. 

## Notices

<span class="label label-danger">Warning:</span>
The extrusion heads and build platform are hot, do not attempt to reach in to the machine while it is printing and ensure all safety covers are in place before you start.

<span class="label label-danger">Warning:</span>
The stepper motors are stronger than they look, do not attempt to put your hands inside the machine while it is moving.

<span class="label label-info">Advice:</span>
The printing process is slow, and as it is our policy to never leave machinery operating unsupervised, be sure you bring a cut lunch and a book if you're printing out a large or complicated item.

<span class="label label-info">Advice:</span>
If your print starts to lean towards one of the corners then you'll need to lubricate the metal bars.
