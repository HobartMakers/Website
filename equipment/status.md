This page is a summary of the condition of the main pieces of equipment in the space. Not everything works all the time in a hackerspace! This list should also help guide you towards the right person if you need help with one of the machines.

Members, please let us know if you have more up to date information or if you'd like to volunteer to be listed as a go-to person for any machine. We would actually like to have more than one go-to person per machine, but our first goal is to fill in the vacancies first.
