## About

The Makerbot replicator was our first major purchase when we opened the space, made possible by generous donations from a number of members.  It is a dual head extrusion type printer which works a little like a hot glue gun pushing out a fine bead of ABS or PLA plastic and layering these on top of each other to make a 3 dimensional object.

Informal instruction on how to use this machine can be provided upon request, we will run through the process of calibrating and operating the machine itself, along with how to produce printable files and what the limitations are.

More information about this machine can be found in the [makerbot replicator user guide](http://www.makerbot.com/blog/2012/03/13/the-makerbot-replicator-user-guide/)


## Notices

<span class="label label-danger">Warning:</span>
The extrusion heads and build platform are hot, do not attempt to reach in to the machine while it is printing and ensure all safety covers are in place before you start.

<span class="label label-danger">Warning:</span>
The stepper motors are stronger than they look, do not attempt to put your hands inside the machine while it is moving.

<span class="label label-info">Advice:</span>
The printing process is slow, and as it is our policy to never leave machinery operating unsupervised, be sure you bring a cut lunch and a book if you're printing out a large or complicated item.

## Repair History

A new PSU (with better current capability than the original) has recently been purchased and installed. Geoff Steer kindly installed the new power supply, and he printed a safe box to contain it, too.

The build plate overheated and burnt a trace, this was repaired by Craig Marshall, and it's now working well again.
