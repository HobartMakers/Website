## About

![LaserPro Mercury Laser Cutter]({{ "/assets/laser-cutter.jpg" | relative_url }} 'LaserPro Mercury Laser Cutter')

This laser cutter is a sealed CO2 laser capable of cutting perspex, glass, wood and MDF, as well as etching and engraving on many surfaces.  The software driving this treats it like a pen plotter, with different pen colours representing different laser power settings and feed rates.

It can also cut an etch using raster images, and this thing is FAST.
