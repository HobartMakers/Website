## About

This machine is a beauty!  A simple workhorse with a powerful three phase spindle motor, this machine is as happy cutting SMD circuit boards as it is cutting boxes out of aluminium.  With software to drive this under Linux or Windows, it is quite easy to learn how to operate.

GCode for this machine can be generated from CAD systems, PCB Design software and from vector paths in Inkscape.

## General Information

Bob has been using this machine with great success to produce robot frames for the Friday Robotics Club.

Our go-to person was Shane Dalgleish - but we really need to find a replacement since Shane's departure in March 2015. In the meantime, other people that have known to have used the machine successfully include: Leo Febey, Bill, Bob Elliot, Craig Marshall.


Shane held several training sessions in the past, but is now living interstate, and this makes it difficult to set up more training.
