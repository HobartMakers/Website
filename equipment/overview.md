## What kind of machinery do we have?

We have a growing collection of tools and machinery in the hackerspace, and here are some of the main items. Click on any entry to get more information:

* Hand Tools
* Power Tools
* 3D Printers
* CNC Router
* Laser Cutter
* Electronics Lab
* Screenprinting equipment



## What's working and what's not?

Our [Equipment Status]({{ "/equipment/status" | relative_url }}) page shows whether an item is currently working or not.

We do all our own maintenance and repairs, so some day you might learn how to re-pack a linear bearing or align a laserbeam!


## What else do we need?

We are 99% funded by membership fees, which we try to keep low to attract new members. Because of this we have very limited funds to purchase new equipment.

Because don't yet have everything we need to make the hackerspace into a functional and general-purpose community workshop, we've begun to compile a wishlist of items that we're on the lookout for:

* Hand tools
  * Vise-grips
  * Clamps
  * Engineers squares
  * Marking scribe
  * Bigger vise
  * Stronger workbenches
* Power tools
  * Cordless drill
  * Belt sander
* Electronics
  * Multimeters
* Metalwork
  * Nuts and bolts
  * Arc welder and welding rods
  * Welding mask
  * Welding gloves
* Woodwork
  * Hand planes
  * Sandpaper
  * Screws

We are **very** grateful to accept donations of tools and equipment. Please contact us if you have anything you would like to donate. Even if your donation is not on the wishlist, if it might be useful to the space, then we would love to hear about it.
