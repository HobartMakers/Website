## About

Recently, we had a donation of a sherline 3" precision lathe. Thanks, Ray! The image to the right is not our lathe, but it's very similar. TODO: Update it with a picture of our actual lathe.

This machine was covered in the dust of ages, but the parts are all in very good condition. The machine has been cleaned and lubed and should be ready to use.

This lathe is quite small and simple to use, but remember - it is a power tool. Think about what you are doing. If in doubt, ask!

More information about these lathes are available [here](http://www.lathes.co.uk/sherline/)
