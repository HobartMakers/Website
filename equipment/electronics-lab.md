## About

![Electronics Lab]({{ "/assets/electronics-lab.jpg" | relative_url }} 'Electronics Lab')

Our electronics work bench is complete with soldering, desoldering, power supply and oscilloscopes, along with hand tools and a large collection of spare parts. If your interest is in making PCBs then we can help you with isolation routing on the CNC Router. We also have a collection of microcontroller dev boards including a classroom set of Arduinos and Raspberry Pis which can be used to learn about the wonderful world of digital electronics.

We have recently built two workbenches for electronics work. There are also plans to build shelving above the workbenches at a suitable height to hold instruments, tools and components. This should make the area much more pleasant to use, and easier to keep tidy.


## Notices

<span class="label label-info">Advice:</span>
The electronics area is often very untidy - please keep the area as clean and tidy as possible.

<span class="label label-danger">Warning:</span>
No one is to work on any mains voltage equipment unless appropriately licensed to do so.


## History

Late 2014 - Both oscilloscopes were set up for use, including voltage calibration, time calibration and probe compensation
