![Robot Club]({{ "/assets/robot-club.jpg" | relative_url }} 'Robot Club')

One of our members, Bob Elliot, runs a Robot Club on Friday afternoons for school-age children in Hobart.

He makes heavy use of the CNC to cut out each wooden chassis.

Bob's often here during open night too (Wednesday evenings), so please ask for him by name, if you want to learn more about the club.
