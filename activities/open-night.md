![Open Night]({{ "/assets/open-night.jpg" | relative_url }} 'Open Night')

Wednesday nights are our open night. We open the doors at 7pm, and are generally open until 9pm or later, and we are open to everyone. Drinks and chocolates are on sale all year round, and in the summer months, we often have a BBQ running too.

These open nights are a great way to get more familiar with what the hackerspace does, and to meet the the people that use the space. We hope to see you at the next one!
